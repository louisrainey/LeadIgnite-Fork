# VIPER in Modern React Frontend (Production-Ready)

## 0. README

This document describes how to implement the VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router) pattern in a production-grade React frontend using your preferred stack. It includes a technology mapping table, directory structure, best practices, and update instructions.

- **Last updated:** 2025-05-05
- **Maintainer:** Ty the Programmer
- **Stack:** React (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Next Router, Zustand, Shadcn, Framer Motion, Spline, Cloudinary, Playwright/Jest, Vercel

## 1. Overview

VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router) is a highly modular frontend architecture pattern. It separates UI, business logic, and navigation for large-scale, testable React apps.

- **View:** UI rendering and styling
- **Interactor:** Business logic, async operations
- **Presenter:** UI logic, event handling, data formatting
- **Entity:** State/data models
- **Router:** Navigation and routing

## 2. Technology Stack Table

| Role       | Technology/Tool             | Purpose/Notes             |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| View       | React, Shadcn, Tailwind CSS | UI rendering, styling     |
| Interactor | Custom Hooks/Services       | Business logic, async ops |
| Presenter  | Custom Hooks/Context        | UI logic, event handling  |
| Entity     | Zustand, React Query        | State, data models        |
| Router     | Next Router                 | Navigation                |
| Animation  | Framer Motion               | UI animations             |
| Media      | Cloudinary, Spline          | Asset management, 3D      |
| Testing    | Playwright, Jest            | E2E/unit testing          |
| CI/CD      | Vercel                      | Deployment                |

## 3. Directory Structure Example

```text
frontend/
  components/    # Views (UI)
  interactors/   # Business logic/services
  presenters/    # UI logic/context
  state/         # Entities (Zustand stores, React Query)
  pages/         # Routing (Next.js)
  styles/        # Tailwind configs
  assets/        # Images, 3D, media
  tests/         # Playwright/Jest
  utils/         # Shared utilities
```

---

## 4. Mapping Stack to VIPER Roles

- **View:** React components, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS for UI
- **Interactor:** Custom hooks/services for business logic
- **Presenter:** Custom hooks/context for UI logic
- **Entity:** Zustand stores, React Query for state/data
- **Router:** Next Router for navigation

---

## 5. Best Practices

- Use strict TypeScript for all files; validate data with Zod if needed
- Keep business logic out of UI components (prefer hooks/services)
- Use React Query for async data and caching
- Memoize expensive logic with useMemo, React.memo
- Modularize state using Zustand slices
- Use Tailwind and Shadcn for consistent, accessible UI
- Write Playwright/Jest tests for all critical flows
- Use dynamic imports and code splitting for performance
- Store global/shared data in state manager or query cache
- Document all architectural decisions and keep this file updated

---

## 6. Update Instructions

- Update this file if the stack, directory structure, or pattern usage changes
- Add a datestamp and your name for traceability
- Review references and keep them current
