How to Bootstrap a Monorepo with PNPM: A Complete Guide

Are you struggling with managing multiple projects, each with its own dependency maze? You've probably heard about monorepos as a solution, but setting one up feels like navigating through a complex labyrinth of configuration files and tooling decisions. Perhaps you've tried different package managers and found yourself switching back to npm out of frustration.

Don't worry â€“ you're not alone. Many developers face these exact challenges when trying to set up a monorepo. The good news is that PNPM offers a straightforward solution that addresses common pain points like dependency management, performance issues, and workspace organization.
Why PNPM for Your Monorepo?

Before diving into the setup, let's understand why PNPM stands out. According to discussions in the Node.js community, developers consistently praise PNPM for its superior performance and efficient dependency management. Unlike traditional package managers, PNPM uses a unique symlink strategy that:

    Saves significant disk space by storing dependencies in a content-addressable store

    Provides true dependency isolation between packages

    Offers faster installation times compared to npm and Yarn

    Prevents the dreaded "dependency hell" through strict package isolation

Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:

    Node.js installed (version 16.13 or higher recommended)

    Git for version control

    Basic familiarity with package managers and JavaScript/TypeScript development

Initial Setup

Let's start by creating our monorepo structure. Open your terminal and follow these steps:

# Create and navigate to your project directory

mkdir pnpm-monorepo
cd pnpm-monorepo

# Initialize git

git init

# Create initial .gitignore

echo "node_modules" > .gitignore

Installing PNPM

First, let's install PNPM globally. The recommended way is using Corepack, which comes with Node.js 16.13+:

corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate

Verify your installation:

pnpm -v

Setting Up Your Monorepo Structure

Now that we have PNPM installed, let's create the basic structure for our monorepo. One of the most common pain points developers face is managing multiple package.json files with different peer dependencies. We'll address this by setting up a clear workspace structure.

    Initialize your project:

pnpm init

# Set the Node.js version requirement

npm pkg set engines.node=">=16.13.0"

# Specify the package manager

npm pkg set packageManager="pnpm@latest"

# Set type as module for ES modules support

npm pkg set type="module"

    Create a workspace configuration file:

# Create pnpm-workspace.yaml

echo "packages:

- 'packages/\*'
- 'apps/\*'" > pnpm-workspace.yaml

# Create directories for your packages and applications

mkdir packages apps

Setting Up Development Tools

To ensure consistency across your monorepo, let's set up essential development tools. Based on community recommendations, we'll implement:

    Prettier for code formatting:

# Install Prettier

pnpm add -D prettier

# Create Prettier configuration

echo '{
"singleQuote": true,
"trailingComma": "es5",
"printWidth": 80,
"tabWidth": 2
}' > .prettierrc.json

# Create Prettier ignore file

echo "coverage
public
dist
pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm-workspace.yaml" > .prettierignore

    ESLint for code quality:

# Install ESLint and its dependencies

pnpm add -D eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin

# Create ESLint configuration

echo '{
"extends": [
"eslint:recommended",
"plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
],
"parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
"plugins": ["@typescript-eslint"],
"root": true
}' > .eslintrc.json

Creating Your First Packages

Now that we have our basic structure and tools in place, let's create our first packages. A common setup includes shared utilities and frontend applications. We'll address the need for efficient type-sharing between frontend and backend in this example.
Creating a Shared Package

    Navigate to the packages directory and create a common utilities package:

cd packages
mkdir common
cd common
pnpm init

    Update the package.json for the common package:

{
"name": "@your-org/common",
"version": "1.0.0",
"type": "module",
"main": "dist/index.js",
"types": "dist/index.d.ts",
"scripts": {
"build": "tsc",
"watch": "tsc -w"
}
}

    Add TypeScript configuration:

# Create tsconfig.json

echo '{
"compilerOptions": {
"target": "ES2020",
"module": "ESNext",
"declaration": true,
"outDir": "./dist",
"strict": true,
"moduleResolution": "node",
"esModuleInterop": true,
"skipLibCheck": true,
"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
},
"include": ["src"],
"exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}' > tsconfig.json

Creating a Frontend Application

    Navigate to the apps directory and create a new React application:

cd ../../apps
mkdir web-app
cd web-app
pnpm init

    Install necessary dependencies:

pnpm add react react-dom
pnpm add -D @types/react @types/react-dom typescript vite @vitejs/plugin-react

    Update the package.json to include the common package:

{
"name": "@your-org/web-app",
"dependencies": {
"@your-org/common": "workspace:\*",
"react": "^18.2.0",
"react-dom": "^18.2.0"
}
}

Managing Dependencies Effectively

One of the biggest challenges in monorepos is managing dependencies across multiple packages. Here are some best practices to follow:

    Use Workspace Protocol: Always use the workspace:* protocol when referencing internal packages:

{
"dependencies": {
"@your-org/common": "workspace:\*"
}
}

    Manage Peer Dependencies: For shared packages, clearly specify peer dependencies to avoid version conflicts:

{
"peerDependencies": {
"react": "^18.0.0",
"react-dom": "^18.0.0"
}
}

Advanced Configuration and Best Practices

To address the concerns about dependency control and package isolation, let's implement some advanced configurations:
Setting Up Git Hooks and Commit Validation

    Install necessary tools:

pnpm add -D husky @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional lint-staged

    Initialize Husky:

pnpm exec husky init

    Create commit message validation:

# Create commitlint config

echo "export default { extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'] };" > commitlint.config.mjs

# Add commit-msg hook

echo "npx --no -- commitlint --edit \${1}" > .husky/commit-msg

Scripts for Common Tasks

Add these helpful scripts to your root package.json:

{
"scripts": {
"build": "pnpm -r build",
"dev": "pnpm -r dev",
"lint": "pnpm -r lint",
"test": "pnpm -r test",
"clean": "pnpm -r clean"
}
}

Troubleshooting Common Issues

Here are solutions to common problems you might encounter:

    Dependency Resolution Issues If you're experiencing dependency conflicts, try:

pnpm store prune # Clean up the store
pnpm install --force # Force reinstall dependencies

    Type Definition Problems For TypeScript projects experiencing type definition issues:

    Ensure your tsconfig.json includes proper path mappings

    Use project references for better type resolution

    Consider using tRPC for full-stack type safety

    Performance Optimization To improve build and development performance:

    Use pnpm instead of npm install in CI/CD pipelines

    Implement proper caching strategies

    Consider using Turborepo for build caching

Conclusion

Setting up a monorepo with PNPM doesn't have to be overwhelming. By following this guide, you've created a solid foundation that addresses common pain points like dependency management, type sharing, and workspace organization. The structure we've set up provides:

    Efficient dependency management through PNPM's unique approach

    Clear separation of concerns with the workspace structure

    Strong typing support across packages

    Consistent code quality through shared tooling

Remember to regularly update your dependencies and maintain your workspace configuration as your project grows. The effort you put into proper setup will pay dividends in improved development efficiency and easier maintenance.
