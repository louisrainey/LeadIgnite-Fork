best practices

is it best practice to remove all pnpm configuration settings from .npmrc to pnpm-workspace.yaml as the new docs replaced Settings (.npmrc) with Settings (pnpm-workspace.yaml) and now all settings are named in camelCase instead of kabab-case which makes me go to old docs for naming and confuses me about what works in .npmrc and pnpm-workspace.yaml and what does not work in .npmrc but works in pnpm-workspace.yaml
eg: node-linker -> nodeLinker
I want to add that I am not annoyed by any changes I just want to follow best practices

Yes, move all the settings to pnpm-workspace.yaml except those related to auth, like the auth token
