Zod not just for form validation

I've been using Zod for a couple of years now and it's firmly in my top 3 favourite libraries of all time.

For me, it's not just the validation. It's the type generation. It's the DX, the way it's built, the modularity and composability.

Not to mention that integration support seems to be everywhere for this library now. Did you know, you can now pass a Zod schema directly to OpenAI, and it will match it's output to the schema? I can pass that same Zod schema directly to a React Hook form and my forms are just validated. I can take that same schema and generate a tRPC endpoint, and my API input will be validated and typed against the schema?

Zod is not just a validation library. It could be a spec in itself for everything from databases to forms to APIs.
