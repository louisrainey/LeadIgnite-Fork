Travis CI steps to secure your data #

Travis CI obfuscates secure environment variables and tokens displayed in the UI. Our documentation about encryption keys outlines the build configuration we require to ensure this, however, once a VM is booted and tests are running, we have less control over what information utilities or add-ons are able to print to the VM’s standard output.

To prevent leaks made by these components, we automatically filter secure environment variables and tokens that are longer than three characters at runtime, effectively removing them from the build log, displaying the string [secure] instead.

Please make sure your secret is never related to the repository or branch name, or any other guessable string. Ideally, you should use a password generation tool such as mkpasswd instead of choosing a secret yourself.

    The beta Windows support does not obfuscate secure environment variables leaked into the build log. Please keep reading the next section, on how to avoid leaking secrets to build logs

Log Scans #

Travis CI has also enabled a mandatory post-job log scan in an attempt to find any other potential leakage of secrets. These scans are carried out on the raw job log files shortly after the build job is completed. Scans are executed using Trivy and detect-secrets, Open Source scanners made available by their maintainers via means of a permissive OSS license. If the scanning process finds an unmasked secret-like entry in the job log, Travis CI, as a precautionary action, will mask the full line in the job log with asterisks (\*) and produce a log scan report, available to the repository administrators for 7 days.

The job log scan report contains details on found potential secrets, referring to the line numbers in the raw job log file, and is meant to help review and find the source of the possible leak and if this proves to be an actual exposition of the secret, the scan fixes that.

When the additional post-job scanning process finds a potential leak in the build-job log, a graphical status in the Travis CI Web UI will present the log scan results. The log scan: failing is displayed over the repository page and in the dashboard for the next 7 days or until at least one of the repository administrators visits the job log scan report page, whichever condition is satisfied first.

Since the job log scan is executed by the tools looking for secret-like entries, the notifications must be treated as a warning about the potential issue and verified by the repository administrator. Therefore, we recommend the following verification steps:

    Reviewing the exact build instructions in the repository .travis.yml file (particularly if any unencrypted secrets are used) and build scripts called from within the .travis.yml recipe.
    Re-running suspicious jobs and reviewing the build job log on the go. Particularly around the preemptively censored area (please mind it will re-trigger the job log scan and any potential notifications in the process).

    Please note: The scan results may produce false positives and/or miss some items due to the nature of the scanners (searching for secret-like patterns). This is continuous work, and we expect it to improve over time based on findings and feedback. Also, we closely monitor the number of warnings raised by the job log scan process and decide later on to enable respective email notifications on top of existing visual indicators.

Leaking secrets to build logs #

Despite our best efforts, there are, however, many ways in which secure information can accidentally be exposed. These vary according to what tools you are using and what settings you have enabled. Some things to look out for are:

    settings which duplicate commands to standard output, such as set -x or set -v in your bash scripts.
    displaying environment variables, by running env or printenv.
    printing secrets within the code, for example echo "$SECRET_KEY".
    using tools that print secrets on error output, such as php -i.
    git commands like git fetch or git push may expose tokens or other secure environment variables.
    mistakes in string escaping.
    settings which increase command verbosity.
    testing tools or plugins that may expose secrets while operating.

Preventing commands from displaying any output is one way to avoid accidentally displaying any secure information. If there is a particular command that is using secure information, you can redirect its output to /dev/null to make sure it does not accidentally publish anything, as shown in the following example:

git push url-with-secret >/dev/null 2>&1

While using Travis CI, you may want to consider the additional means to decrease the risk of exposing secrets in the build job logs:
Use encrypted secrets #

Travis CI offers the ability to either encrypt your secret with the Travis-CLI (command line interface tool) or define the secret in the Travis CI Repository Settings.

Shall the secret be stored in an encrypted file within your source code repository, you may instead encrypt a file with a secret and use it during the build job. Decrypt your file for the shortest time needed and remove any temporary environment variables from the build job environment as soon as these are not necessary.

Please mind that at some point, the secret, in order to be used, must be decrypted for the build job environment. Thus debug outputs to the standard outputs may still result in secret exposure. The additional post-job log scanning process is meant to find as many of these as possible.
Use the Hashicorp Vault KMS integration #

If you manage your secrets using the Hashicorp Vault KMS (Key Management System), then you may use the existing Travis CI - Hashicorp integration to obtain secrets directly to the build job.

Again, please be wary of any possible debug outputs to the standard outputs in the build job environment. The additional post-job log scanning process is meant to find as many of these as possible. The advantage of pulling the secret from a KMS managed by you is the ability to rotate it from a single secret repository in case of any incident. We strongly recommend using Hashicorp Vault credentials limited to a specific set of CI/CD-related secrets to limit the threat scope for the KMS.
Limit job log access #

Review who and why should have access to the build job logs and set the appropriate options in the Travis CI Repository Settings.
Settings review for fork repository builds #

Review the Travis CI Repository Settings and adjust what should be shared with forks. This is meant for a collaboration pattern when a forked repository can file a Pull Request to the base repository, thus triggering a CI/CD build job with automated build and tests as a part of the Pull Request validation and approval process. Assess the risks and adjust settings to your scenario.
Run builds requiring secrets in private repositories #

If this is a viable option, consider running builds requiring the usage of secrets as a CI/CD for private repositories with a carefully reviewed collaborator list. Combined with the above options, it should decrease the risk of secret exposition in the build job log.
Take control of exposing secure information #

As an initial step, it’s possible to delete logs containing any secure information by clicking the Remove log button on the build log page of Travis CI.

remove log button

If you discover a leak in one of your build logs, it’s essential that you revoke the leaked token or environment variable and update any build scripts or commands that caused the leak.
Alternative log-deleting methods #

Instead of deleting build logs manually, you can do so using the Travis CI CLI or the API.
Rotate tokens and secrets periodically #

Rotate your tokens and secrets regularly. GitHub OAuth tokens can be found in your Developer Settings on the GitHub site. Please regularly rotate credentials for other third-party services as well.

Software development often consists of confidential information and code sequences that could put companies in a vulnerable position if leaked into the hands of competitors. CI/CD pipeline security is a necessity during every stage of the development and deployment process. Learn how the best ci/cd security tools can ensure the privacy of your source code, scan for vulnerabilities, and stop breach attempts in their tracks.
CI/CD Security Tools
User Access Controls

A secure CI/CD pipeline requires user access controls. Continuous integration and deployment systems thrive on the convenience of multiple users but need controls in place to maximize protection.

User access controls permit only those who need access to gain entry to important repository files. Software developers can tighten access controls by limiting sensitive information to essential staff only and keeping a comprehensive record of who has access to what.
Static Application of CI/CD Security Scanning

Static analysis tools are a fundamental part of CI/CD security scanning. Users can automate vulnerability scans for code with Travis CI integration. Scripts written by your team need to be scanned for gaps in code that outsiders could potentially access. During the test phase, container scanning tools are especially helpful.

Third-party code segments from modules or libraries can also be scanned with the use of source composition analysis tools (SCA tools). For extra precautionary measures, companies should also assess all devices that have access to the pipeline to ensure that they meet security requirements.
Runtime Security

Runtime security detects active potential threats during the final stages of your continuous deployment process. Application and audit logs, as well as network metrics, contribute to runtime security and allow the detection of threats before they reach an urgent status. By vetting all activities within a container application environment and looking for any activity that violates custom-set rules, you can prevent malicious activity from occurring.
Private Certificates and Encryption Keys

Private certificate authorities allow secure communication between software development team members and can be used to verify different identities using the CI/CD system. An example of implementing a private certificate is using it to ensure the code that is deployed in the production pipeline was written by a trusted source. They can also encrypt and decrypt sensitive data with private encryption keys that authenticate data transmitted during the automated CI/CD pipeline.  
Implementing CI/CD Security in Your DevOps
Designate Separate Duties

Define role-based access control privilege policies when starting your software development team or onboarding to a new CI/CD system. Having varying levels of access and user permissions for each employee with designated duties can protect a software company’s reputation and safety.

By reducing access to sensitive information within the CI/CD pipeline, your company reduces the “attack surface.” Fewer people having access minimizes the likelihood of security breaches and makes it easier for supervisors to monitor suspicious activity within logs and reports. The varying levels of access for specific roles encourage increased accountability within your organization. Each person has a clear outline of their tasks and responsibilities, making it easier for your software development team to identify who is responsible for any security mishaps or mistakes in code scripts.
Lock Your Code Repository

A CI/CD security best practice is to privatize source code repositories with passwords and other security measures, such as identity-verifying questions and two-factor authentication. Locking a repository helps with continuous integration security by controlling code changes, enforcing the access controls your company sets, and facilitating compliance with company security standards.

If a change is made to your source code, your project management team will easily be able to locate the source. A helpful practice for establishing a secure CI/CD pipeline is to rotate passwords after each use, confusing the culprits behind any breach attempts and ensuring that if they gain access to the repository once, they likely won’t again.
Learn to Write Secure Code

Travis CI helps software developers to find vulnerabilities in their source code. Our automated CI/CD pipeline tools also simplify code for users, enabling them to achieve the same commands with fewer lines of code. The simpler the code is, the less space there is for vulnerabilities that can allow outsiders to obtain sensitive information about your developing software project.

Simple code results in a secure CI/CD pipeline because it is easier to understand and maintain. When looking for source code vulnerabilities, keep in mind that it’s easier to search a clean and organized room for an object than a messy and chaotic one. Similarly, clean code will enable your team to find any security incidents before they become major problems.
Keep Tabs on Revision History

Regularly watching your revision history to oversee changes made in the source code repository is essential for CI/CD pipeline security. A user activity audit can be generated to monitor these changes, and the best CI/CD security tools will have searchability and filters that make scanning the audit a simple process.

Travis CI goes the extra mile with audit and user log security. Our system censors sensitive information in the open text of build job logs while allowing project leaders to search the log database for proprietary information like passwords, keys, and tokens. Independent scanners can scan build logs immediately after the build is completed, generating a report available to repository administrators. This makes any breaches in security easier to spot and manage, prompting project leaders to investigate the source of the abnormal activity.
Maximize CI/CD Security with Travis CI
