husky init (recommended)

The init command simplifies setting up husky in a project. It creates a pre-commit script in .husky/ and updates the prepare script in package.json. Modifications can be made later to suit your workflow.
npm
pnpm
yarn
bun
shell

npx husky init

Try it

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your first Git hook with just one command 🎉. Let's test it:
shell

git commit -m "Keep calm and commit"

# test script will run every time you commit

A few words...
Scripting

While most of the time, you'll just run a few npm run or npx commands in your hooks, you can also script them using POSIX shell for custom workflows.

For example, here's how you can lint your staged files on each commit with only two lines of shell code and no external dependency:
shell

# .husky/pre-commit

prettier $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR | sed 's| |\\ |g') --write --ignore-unknown
git update-index --again

This is a basic but working example, check lint-staged if you need more.
Disabling hooks
Husky doesn't force Git hooks. It can be globally disabled (HUSKY=0) or be opt-in if wanted. See the How To section for manual setup and more information.
