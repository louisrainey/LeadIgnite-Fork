OWASP Testing Guides

In terms of technical security testing execution, the OWASP testing guides are highly recommended. Depending on the types of the applications, the testing guides are listed below for the web/cloud services, Mobile app (Android/iOS), or IoT firmware respectively.

Penetration Testing Execution Standard

Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) defines penetration testing as 7 phases. Particularly, PTES Technical Guidelines give hands-on suggestions on testing procedures, and recommendation for security testing tools.

    Pre-engagement Interactions
    Intelligence Gathering
    Threat Modeling
    Vulnerability Analysis
    Exploitation
    Post Exploitation
    Reporting

PTES Technical Guidelines
PCI Penetration Testing Guide

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Requirement 11.3 defines the penetration testing. PCI also defines Penetration Testing Guidance.
PCI DSS Penetration Testing Guidance

The PCI DSS Penetration testing guideline provides guidance on the following:

    Penetration Testing Components
    Qualifications of a Penetration Tester
    Penetration Testing Methodologies
    Penetration Testing Reporting Guidelines

PCI DSS Penetration Testing Requirements

The PCI DSS requirement refer to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Requirement 11.3

    Based on industry-accepted approaches
    Coverage for CDE and critical systems
    Includes external and internal testing
    Test to validate scope reduction
    Application-layer testing
    Network-layer tests for network and OS

Penetration Testing Framework

The Penetration Testing Framework (PTF) provides comprehensive hands-on penetration testing guide. It also lists usages of the security testing tools in each testing category. The major area of penetration testing includes:

    Network Footprinting (Reconnaissance)
    Discovery & Probing
    Enumeration
    Password cracking
    Vulnerability Assessment
    AS/400 Auditing
    Bluetooth Specific Testing
    Cisco Specific Testing
    Citrix Specific Testing
    Network Backbone
    Server Specific Tests
    VoIP Security
    Wireless Penetration
    Physical Security

Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment

Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment (NIST 800-115) was published by NIST, it includes some assessment techniques listed below.

    Review Techniques
    Target Identification and Analysis Techniques
    Target Vulnerability Validation Techniques
    Security Assessment Planning
    Security Assessment Execution
    Post-Testing Activities

The NIST 800-115 can be accessed here
Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual

The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) is a methodology to test the operational security of physical locations, workflow, human security testing, physical security testing, wireless security testing, telecommunication security testing, data networks security testing and compliance. OSSTMM can be supporting reference of ISO 27001 instead of a hands-on or technical application penetration testing guide.

OSSTMM includes the following key sections:

    Security Analysis
    Operational Security Metrics
    Trust Analysis
    Work Flow
    Human Security Testing
    Physical Security Testing
    Wireless Security Testing
    Telecommunications Security Testing
    Data Networks Security Testing
    Compliance Regulations
    Reporting with the STAR (Security Test Audit Report)
