Python for code analysis

Snyk Code relies on Python Projects' adhering to a standard directory layout for accurate analysis. Specifically, Snyk Code expects Projects to be compatible with setuptools automatic discovery, which identifies packages and modules automatically based on the directory structure. Both src-layout and flat-layout are supported.

For further details, see the setuptools automatic package discovery documentation. Proper adherence to these conventions allows the scanner to trace code effectively and provide accurate results.

Refer to the Python detail for supported frameworks, libraries, and features.
