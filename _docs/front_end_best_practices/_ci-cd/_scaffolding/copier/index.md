Comparing Copier to other project generators¶

The subject of code scaffolding has been around for some time, and there are long established good projects.

Here's a simple comparison. If you find something wrong, please open a PR and fix these docs! We don't want to be biased, but it's easy that we tend to be:

Important

Although Copier was born as a code scaffolding tool, it is today a code lifecycle management tool. This makes it somehow unique. Most tools below are only scaffolders and the comparison is not complete due to that.

    The file itself can include other YAML files. ↩

    Git repo is recommended to be able to use advanced features such as template tagging and smart updates. ↩

    A suffix is required by default. Defaults to .jinja, but can be configured to use a different suffix, or to use none. ↩

    Only for Git templates, because Copier uses Git tags to obtain available versions and extract smart diffs between them. ↩

    Context hooks are provided through the ContextHook extension. ↩

    Updates are possible through Cruft. ↩
