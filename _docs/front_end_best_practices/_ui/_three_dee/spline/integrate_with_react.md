Meet Spline

Spline is a full-fledged 3D tool that is widely considered the Figma of 3D tools. It has everything you’d expect in a modern design tool: simple interface, real-time collaboration, a library of sample files and it works in the browser which means compatible with Mac, Windows and Tablets. It even has interactions and code export directly to CodeSandBox.

This Course

You will learn how to recreate your UI in 3D, from Figma to Spline. You’ll also get a crash course on how Spline works and I’ll explain how to export your 3D asset to implement on a React site.

Getting Started

In order to follow this course, you need to download the assets file which includes the Figma template, Spline file and the PNG files to recreate the D’accord UI.
Interactions

What sets spline apart is the ability to add interactions like mouse events, scroll wheel, keyboard shortcuts, start and drag gesture to any 3D element. For each event, there are a number of options like transition, duration and states to compose your perfect interaction. Most importantly, this makes your 3D asset usable on a website, inside a promo video or an interactive prototype. I can definitely see a future where 3D prototyping can be a viable skill.

Rendering

One of the key issues with most design tools is the wait time for the rendering. Depending on the complexity of the 3D environment, rendering a high-resolution, pixel perfect render can take hours. In this department, Spline is like magic. You always get a full quality render every time you edit and all this, without the cost of performance.
Real time collaboration

Figma really popularized real-time collaboration in the browser. Ever since, we’ve seen that feature in design tools like Sketch, Framer and now it’s available in Spline. In a team environment, this is a crucial feature that saves a lot of time and helps the feedback process.
Export Code

When you create an asset in Spline, you can customize the Frame size, interaction options, and performance before exporting to code in HTML, Webflow or React. What’s even cooler is the ability to directly export code in CodeSandbox. This makes it super easy to set up your site, your libraries and deployment with a few clicks.

Figma Template

Designing a landing page with a 3D asset requires some planning in Figma. Also, we will recreate the D’accord UI in 3D using Spline. It is necessary to download the template to follow each step.

Download Spline

You can download Spline for Mac or Windows. You can also use it directly in the browser which is convenient on the go and on devices like the iPad.
Library

When you first start using Spline, you have access to a number of high-quality files that you can open, inspect and edit. Many of these beautiful 3D assets are also taught from scratch in their YouTube channel.
