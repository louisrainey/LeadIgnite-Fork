🎨 Intuitive Material System

In Spline, materials are designed with a layer-based system, allowing you to easily control the appearance of an object by adding or adjusting layers in a vertical stack. This intuitive method makes it simple to customize your designs and is similar to the workflow found in many graphic design tools, offering a fresh take compared to traditional 3D editors.

Creating Material Layers

🧑‍💻 Variables and Data

Unlock the full potential of interactive 3D experiences by using advanced features such as Variables, which allow you to dynamically control and manipulate objects within your scenes. Additionally, you can integrate with APIs, enabling the real-time display of live data. This means you can create immersive environments that respond to user input or external data sources instantly.
