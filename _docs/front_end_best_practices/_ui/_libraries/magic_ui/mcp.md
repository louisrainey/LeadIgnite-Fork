Magic UI MCP Server

Learn how to use the Model Context Protocol with Magic UI.

Magic UI now has an official MCP server ðŸŽ‰.

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.

This is useful for Magic UI because you can now give your AI-assisted IDE direct access to all Magic UI components so that it can generate code with minimal errors.
Installation

pnpm dlx @magicuidesign/cli@latest install cursor

Restart your IDE
Usage

You can now ask your IDE to use any Magic UI component. Here are some examples:

    "Add a blur fade text animation"
    "Add a grid background"
    "Add a vertical marquee of logos"
