Final thoughts on adopting Shadcn UI

When it comes to front-end development, efficiency and consistency are key. For years, we relied on SCSS to build custom UI components, which worked well for large projects. However, when we needed a good looking UI quickly, the process often felt too slow and complicated. The setup, maintenance, and design consistency required significant effort, making it difficult to balance speed and quality.

Enter Shadcn UI.

Switching to Shadcn UI dramatically improved our development workflow. It didn’t just simplify UI creation, it streamlined the entire process from design to deployment. The modular, component-based approach, combined with Tailwind CSS and Figma integration, brought a major transformation in how we build user interfaces. In this post, we’ll explore how Shadcn UI improved our workflow, the benefits it brought, and how it compares to our traditional SCSS approach.
What makes Shadcn UI stand out?

Modular component system

Shadcn UI takes a different approach from traditional UI libraries. Instead of a monolithic component library, it offers a collection of reusable components that you install individually. This means you only include what you need, keeping your project lightweight and manageable. With the code directly in your repository, customization is straightforward without the need for excessive overrides, and you gain a significant amount of control over your components.

With SCSS, we had to create components from scratch or use a pre-existing UI library that often required extensive modifications. The ability to individually install and tweak components in Shadcn UI removed unnecessary dependencies and ensured our UI remained lightweight.
Tailwind CSS for styling

Shadcn UI is built on Tailwind CSS, a utility-first framework that speeds up styling. Instead of switching between SCSS files and HTML, you apply styles directly within your JSX or HTML using utility classes. This not only enhances efficiency but also ensures design consistency across your project. Tailwind also provides built-in responsiveness, dark mode support, and accessibility features.

In contrast, SCSS required us to manage multiple stylesheets, ensuring that styles were modular, maintainable, and free from conflicts. This added layers of complexity, especially when scaling projects. With Tailwind, we can apply styles inline, reducing context switching and improving development speed.
Seamless Figma integration

One of the biggest advantages of Shadcn UI is its integration with Figma. Designers can use pre-made Figma templates that mirror the components in the codebase, ensuring alignment between design and development. This eliminates discrepancies and accelerates the iteration process.

Previously, we spent a lot of time translating Figma designs into SCSS-based components. With Shadcn UI, the process is significantly smoother, as we can reference ready-made components that match our design system.
Accessibility and best practices

Shadcn UI is built on Radix, a headless UI library focused on accessibility. Components come with ARIA attributes, proper focus management, and keyboard navigation out of the box. It also follows modern design patterns and uses semantic HTML, making your applications more user-friendly and SEO-optimized.

With SCSS, accessibility often depends on developer diligence. Ensuring proper focus management, keyboard navigation, and ARIA attributes requires additional effort. Shadcn UI eliminates this by integrating accessibility best practices by default.

Why you should choose Shadcn UI
Faster development

Pre-built components and Tailwind’s utility classes drastically reduce UI development time. Instead of writing extensive stylesheets, developers can leverage Tailwind’s utility classes and Shadcn UI components, making it possible to build interfaces in minutes rather than hours.
Better design consistency

Figma integration ensures alignment between design and code. Developers and designers work from the same component set, reducing miscommunications and discrepancies between mockups and the final UI.
Lightweight & performant

Shadcn UI allows developers to install only the components they need, keeping the project streamlined. Additionally, Tailwind’s purge feature automatically removes unused styles, ensuring an optimized and efficient codebase.
Built-in accessibility

Ensuring accessibility can be challenging, especially in large-scale applications. Shadcn UI takes the guesswork out by providing accessible components out of the box, ensuring compliance with WCAG guidelines.
Improved developer experience

Minimal setup, easy customization, and strong community support make Shadcn UI a pleasure to work with. Developers no longer have to wrestle with complex SCSS configurations, making onboarding smoother for new team members.
Real-world use cases
Rapid prototyping

For projects that require quick UI iterations, Shadcn UI is a perfect choice. Its ready-made components and Tailwind integration allow teams to move fast without compromising design consistency.
Scalable web applications

For larger applications, managing styles with SCSS can become cumbersome. Shadcn UI’s modular approach ensures that the UI remains maintainable and scalable, reducing technical debt.
Accessibility-first projects

Applications that require compliance with accessibility standards benefit greatly from Shadcn UI’s built-in accessibility features, reducing the effort required to implement ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation manually.
Final thoughts on adopting Shadcn UI

Transitioning from SCSS to Shadcn UI has been a game-changer for our team. It’s not just about working faster, it’s about creating better, more maintainable, and accessible UIs. The modular approach, combined with Tailwind CSS and Figma integration, has made our workflow smoother and more efficient.

If you’re still relying on SCSS or just Tailwind for UI development, it’s worth giving Shadcn UI a try. It addresses many pain points of traditional workflows while ensuring your UI is modern, consistent, and high-performing. The benefits of faster development, better design alignment, improved performance, and built-in accessibility make it an excellent choice for modern front-end development.

Shadcn UI isn’t just a tool, it’s a shift in how we approach UI development. By embracing this new methodology, developers can build visually appealing, high-performing, and accessible interfaces with ease. If you’re looking for an alternative to monolithic UI libraries or CSS frameworks that offers efficiency and consistency, Shadcn UI is the way forward.
