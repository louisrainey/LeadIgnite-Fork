To optimize performance in Next.js applications, consider implementing server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) for faster load times. Use the built-in image optimization features to serve images in the best format and size. Additionally, leverage dynamic imports for code splitting, minimize the use of large dependencies, and optimize API calls. Regularly analyze your application using tools like Lighthouse to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement. Engaging with the community for tips and examples can also provide valuable insights.
