Overview
Content Type Builder updates Beta

Interface modifications and new options are available in the Content-type Builder, including:

    tags to indicate the status of the fields and content types: "N" for new, "M" for modified and "D" for deleted,
    an * beside required fields in the list view,
    a drag & drop button in the list view, to reorder the fields,
    and collapse button for dynamic zones and components.

The Save button has also been moved to the Content-type Builder navigation which lists all content types and components. This, along with the status tags, allows you to work on several content types and components at the same time. Revert, Undo and Discard changes button have also been added, which also work globally on all content types and components.

The Content-type Builder allows the creation and management of content-types, which can be:

    Collection types: content-types that can manage several entries.
    Single types: content-types that can only manage one entry.
    Components: content structure that can be used in multiple collection types and single types. Although they are technically not proper content-types because they cannot exist independently, components are also created and managed through the Content-type Builder, in the same way as collection and single types.

All 3 are displayed as categories in the sub navigation of the Content-type Builder. In each category are listed all content-types and components that have already been created.
Tip

Click the search icon in the Content-type Builder sub navigation to find a specific collection type, single type, or component.
Usage
Creating content-types

The Content-type Builder allows to create new content-types: single and collection types, but also components.
New content-type Content-type creation

    Choose whether you want to create a collection type or a single type.
    In the Content-type Builder's category of the content-type you want to create, click on Create new collection/single type.
    In the content-type creation window, write the name of the new content-type in the Display name textbox.
    Check the API ID to make sure the automatically pre-filled values are correct. Collection type names are indeed automatically pluralized when displayed in the Content Manager. It is recommended to opt for singular names, but the API ID field allows to fix any pluralization mistake.
    (optional) In the Advanced Settings tab, configure the available settings for the new content-type:
    Setting name	Instructions
    Draft & publish	Tick the checkbox to allow entries of the content-type to be managed as draft versions, before they are published (see Draft & Publish).
    Internationalization	Tick the checkbox to allow entries of the content-type to be translated into other locales.
    Click on the Continue button.
    Add and configure chosen fields for your content-type (see Configuring fields for content-types).
    Click on the Save button.

Caution

New content-types are only considered created once they have been saved. Saving is only possible if at least one field has been added and properly configured. If these steps have not been done, a content-type cannot be created, listed in its category in the Content-type Builder, and cannot be used in the Content Manager.
New component Component creation

    In the Components category of the Content-type Builder sub navigation, click on Create new component.
    In the component creation window, configure the base settings of the new component:
        Write the name of the component in the Display name textbox.
        Select an available category, or enter in the textbox a new category name to create one.
        (optional) Choose an icon representing the new component. You can use the search to find an icon instead of scrolling through the list.
    Click on the Continue button.
    Add and configure chosen fields for your component (see Configuring fields for content-types).
    Click on the Save button.

Editing content-types

The Content-type Builder allows to manage all existing content-types. For an chosen content-type or component to edit, the right side of the Content-type Builder interface displays all available editing and management options.
Content-type Builder's edition interface

    Click on the Add new/another field button 1 in the top right corner to add more fields to your content-type.

    In the table that displays the fields of your content-type 2, click on the and/or buttons to respectively edit and/or delete these fields.

    Click on the Edit button 3 to access the basic and advanced settings of your content-type:
        Basic settings
        Advanced settings

    The Basic Settings tab allows to edit the following properties of the content-type or component:
    Content-type Builder's basic settings
        Display name: Name of the content-type or component as it will be displayed in the admin panel.
        API ID (singular): Name of the content-type or component as it will be used in the API. It is automatically generated from the display name, but can be edited.
        API ID (plural): Plural name of the content-type or component as it will be used in the API. It is automatically generated from the display name, but can be edited.
        Type: Type of the content-type or component. It can be either a Collection type or a Single type.

    Click on the Save button 4 to confirm any ongoing modification.

Caution

Editing a field allows renaming it. However, keep in mind that regarding the database, renaming a field means creating a whole new field and deleting the former one. Although nothing is deleted from the database, the data that was associated with the former field name will not be accessible from the admin panel of your application anymore.
Configuring content-types fields

Content-types are composed of one or several fields. Each field is designed to contain specific kind of data, filled up in the Content Manager (see Creating & Writing content).

In the Content-type Builder, fields can be added at the creation of a new content-type or component, or afterward when a content-type or component is edited or updated.
Note

Depending on what content-type or component is being created or edited, not all fields -including components and dynamic zones- are always available.

Components

Components are a combination of several fields. Components allow to create reusable sets of fields, that can be quickly added to content-types, dynamic zones but also nested into other components.

When configuring a component through the Content-type Builder, it is possible to either:

    create a new component by clicking on Create a new component (see Creating a new component),
    or use an existing one by clicking on Use an existing component.

    Base settings
    Advanced settings

Setting name Instructions
Name Write the name of the dynamic zone for the content-type.

After configuring the settings of the dynamic zone, its components must be configured as well. It is possible to either choose an existing component or create a new one.
Caution

When using dynamic zones, different components cannot have the same field name with different types (or with enumeration fields, different values).
Custom fields

Custom fields are a way to extend Strapi’s capabilities by adding new types of fields to content-types or components. Once installed (see Marketplace documentation), custom fields are listed in the Custom tab when selecting a field for a content-type.

Each custom field type can have basic and advanced settings. The Marketplace lists available custom fields, and hosts dedicated documentation for each custom field, including specific settings.
Deleting content-types

Content types and components can be deleted through the Content-type Builder. Deleting a content-type automatically deletes all entries from the Content Manager that were based on that content-type. The same goes for the deletion of a component, which is automatically deleted from every content-type or entry where it was used.

    In the Content-type Builder sub navigation, click on the name of the content-type or component to delete.
    In the edition interface of the chosen content-type or component, click on the Edit button on the right side of the content-type's or component's name.
    In the edition window, click on the Delete button.
    In the confirmation window, confirm the deletion.

Caution

Deleting a content-type only deletes what was created and available from the Content-type Builder, and by extent from the admin panel of your Strapi application. All the data that was created based on that content-type is however kept in the database. For more information, please refer to the related GitHub issue.
