Setup the project
Prerequisites

Only a few tools are required to build and run Rolldown. You'll need:

    Install Rust via rustup
    Install just

You could install just quickly by running the following command or by following the official guide:
Npm
Pnpm
Yarn
Homebrew
Cargo

pnpm --global add just-install

    Install cmake

You could install it by following the official Download.

    Install Node.js >= 22.14.0 / 21.2.0

just setup

On your first checkout of the repository, all you need to do is run just setup in the repository root.

If you are seeing ✅✅✅ Setup complete! at the end, that means you have everything you need to build and run rolldown.

You could run just roll to verify if everything is working correctly.

TIP

    just roll might take a while to run, since it will build rolldown from scratch and run all the tests.
    If you want to know what just setup does under the hood, you can check the justfile in the repository root.

Now, you could move to next chapter Building and Running. Continue reading if you want to have a in-depth understanding of the setup process.
In Depth

This section will go into more detail about the installed tools and dependencies required to build and run Rolldown.
Setup Rust

Rolldown is built on Rust and requires rustup and cargo to exist in your environment. You can install Rust from the official website.
Setup Node.js

Rolldown is a npm package built with NAPI-RS and is published to the npm registry, and as such requires Node.js and pnpm (for dependency management).

We recommend installing Node.js with a version manager, like nvm or fnm. Make sure to install and use Node.js version 22.14.0+, which is the minimum requirement for this project. You can skip this step if you are already using a Node.js version manager of your choice and on a Node.js version that meets the requirement.
Setup pnpm

We recommend enabling pnpm via corepack, so the correct version of pnpm can be automatically used when working in this project:

corepack enable

to verify that everything is setup correctly.
