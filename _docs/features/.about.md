ad Ignite – Business Summary
Lead Ignite is a modern SaaS platform designed for real estate investors and wholesalers to automate and optimize the process of lead generation, outreach, and qualification.

Core Value Proposition
Automates lead generation and outreach: Users can generate targeted contact lists or upload their own, and the system automatically initiates outbound calls using an AI voice assistant (VAPI).
CRM integration: Seamlessly syncs leads, call outcomes, and tags with GoHighLevel (GHL), ensuring all data is centralized and actionable within the user’s CRM.
Intelligent lead qualification: The AI assistant gathers key information, detects voicemails, and tags leads (e.g., interested, callback needed, do-not-call) based on real conversations, reducing manual effort and human error.
Business-hour aware scheduling: Calls are only placed during user-configured business hours, maximizing response rates and regulatory compliance.
Real-time analytics and workflow automation: Users can track lead statuses, view call analytics, and manage follow-ups from a unified dashboard, while admins can automate and monitor lead generation and outreach campaigns.
End-to-end workflow: From intake to qualification to CRM sync and follow-up, Lead Ignite streamlines the full sales pipeline.
